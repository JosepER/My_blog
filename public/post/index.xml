      <description>IntroductionMy main reason to love Game of Thrones (GoT) is that is a serie with ruthless and unpredictable narratives. It shows a world with a large amount of rich and absorbing characters that are always on the edge between life and death.
Criticism sparked after the last two seasons were aired1. The show seems to have become more fast-paced, spending less time in slowly-building complex stories and more in action-like scenes.</description>
