<p><strong>Introduction</strong> <em>something about GoT/what is GoT?</em></p>
<p>My main reason to love Game of Thrones is that is a serie with ruthless and unpredictable narratives. It shows a world with a large amount of rich and absorbing characters that are always on the edge between life and death.</p>
<p>Criticism however, has sparked after the last two seasons<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. The show seems to have become more fast-paced, spending less time in slowly-building complex stories and more in action-like scenes. This might have got to a point where deaths don’t appear so tragic any more as espectators empathise less with characters.</p>
<p>In this series of posts I will try to explore if these patterns of changes can be seen in unoficial GoT scripts. Thus, my intention is to first start with a post analysing counts of character appearances in scripts and how these evolve in the last seasons.</p>
<p>First article This should give us a glimpse at: * which are the main characters of the series? Does their protagonism change across seasons? * *</p>
<p><em>what I intend to do? why is this important</em></p>
<p>Series of articles to start my blog. Some people have done similar articles in the past, but not answered the same questions. Credit them.</p>

<p>Probably less interested in predicting and more in explaining.</p>
<p>Main question:</p>
<p>Criticism of what GoT has become in the last two seasons. Can we observe these differences in scripts? Did the more fast-paced episodes mean that the number of characters that appear in the last seasons decrease? Did the total number of appearances (i.e. number of times character talk) by episode decrease? Last, did GoT become a less merciless show, killing less important character only in the last two seasons?</p>
